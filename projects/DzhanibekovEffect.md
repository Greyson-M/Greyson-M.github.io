# Dzhanibekov Effect

The Dzhanibekov effect is a phenomenon in which a rotating rigid body exhibits unexpected motion due to its moments of inertia. The effect is a result of the intermediate axis theorem, which states that a rigid body rotating about its intermediate axis is unstable.

A couple of objects rotating about their intermediate axes.

This effect comes from Euler's equations of motion for a rigid body:

$$
I \dot{\omega} + \omega \times (I\omega) = 0
$$

This numerical simulation was rendered using a custom 3D rendering engine written in C++. The effect is most notable when the body is not subjected to gravity or other external forces, as shown in the simulation.
